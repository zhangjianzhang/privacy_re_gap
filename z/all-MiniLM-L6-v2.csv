Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made.

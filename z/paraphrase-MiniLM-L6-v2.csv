This is a Public service announcement and a review about Facebook the company better known as Facebook has flagged my email and has disabled my account for no reason at all. Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made. I would not recommend this social platform for anybody because they track you using GEO location on your phone, monitor your microphone, and camera, and watch you 24/7  they require your physical address, phone number, and email, they require you to upload a photo ID or birth certificate.

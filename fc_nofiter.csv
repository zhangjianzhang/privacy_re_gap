Fb used to have better privacy settings that way when you set your profile to private absolutely no one youre not friends with can see your pictures or about me info.

This is a Public service announcement and a review about Facebook the company better known as Facebook has flagged my email and has disabled my account for no reason at all. Example I went two whole weeks without using Facebook messenger or any associated app or website, I was dormant in using the app and as soon as I logged in I was logged back out automatically and notified I violated their community guidelines. Once I was put on notice I had the option to file a request for a  review of my account where I was then asked to upload a picture of my photo ID, so I managed to regain access to delete that account and created a new account under a different email and two days later was automatically signed out of my account  yet again and was notified that I was using multiple accounts and had to confirm the account I had deleted or permanently loose the account I had just made. I would not recommend this social platform for anybody because they track you using GEO location on your phone, monitor your microphone, and camera, and watch you 24/7  they require your physical address, phone number, and email, they require you to upload a photo ID or birth certificate. Meta previously known as Facebook is in association with 3rd party corporations in China where they take all data collected on you and sell it to big businesses and profit off your rights to use their services. They monitor each like, comment, and message made through Facebook app or messenger. It is not safe and idk why its even legal to use in the United States. As far as Im concerned Facebook is a CIA platform and is only free to the public to monitor and track each person online. They even monitor you when you arent using their app. As long as you have the app downloaded on your device regardless online or offline they still watch and monitor you, they track your microphone and your camera so Id be advised and delete the app, go to something else like MySpace, or something.",,,,

They intentionally do not allow you to update the photos they have access to from the app. If you cannot select which photos you want to share with them, you may be more inclined to share all of your photos out of convenience.

Ill share my experience with Facebook as a business owner and you be the judge but according to Facebook I chose to use its platform So as a modern business if youre not utilizing social media and the various platforms to grow, gain visibility etc youre missing out massively but its a double edged sword as they have ZERO customer support of any kind. During the start of this pandemic all SIX yes SIX Facebook/Instagram accounts associated with my business that Ive been building over 7 years now (I had no marks on my acts, never broke rules, policies etc) all just vanished. 100% deleted and removed from the platform with ZERO explanation given. Mind you I was paying THOUSANDS of dollars a month in ads what do I get in return? My entire lifes work deleted.. as if owning a small business isnt hard enough to survive during a global pandemic losing over $250k USD over 10months while fighting to get my accounts back even working with a marketing agency with direct access to a so called Facebook Rep they are useless. I still have ZERO answers as to what happen and or why, but my life, finances, and business was destroyed for no reason all while having covid twice and at this point Im likely permanently disabled from how I previously was.   They are not liable in anyway for directly causing my online business to fail and bleed out hundreds of thousands of dollars because you accepted terms and conditions the only thing I was told was it was a glitch so cool over your glitches and awful algorithms you can destroy entire lives and not be held accountable in anyway shape or form. Facebook only has value because of its users.. you should VALUE your users and business clients in return as without all of us youre worthless. The most ridiculous thing is if I want to continue I have no other option but to get back on Facebook & Instagram and try again this is beyond wrong and Im sick of building my mansion in Facebooks backyard for them to just lock you out and say thanks for playing.

Errors all over the app. However, their entire self policing thing is.... a mess. I have been put on post bans for things that do follow the community guidelines, however if I report someone saying something genuinely awful like... okay the most recent... so a friend shared a post about a family that had lost their trailer in a fire. Thankfully they were not there, but they lost everything and have a baby. Do they were asking for donations for... everything. And someone posted that an abortion would take care of the babies needs. The baby is several months old and even if it wasn\'t that is not something you say to someone who is pregnant. Nothing was done. However I got hit because I was trying to correct someone\'s ignorance about why Rome failed with a link to an article written by actual historians and got marked as spam. If all my friends weren\'t on here, I wouldn\'t use it. I use it specifically to stay in contact with friends and mindless meme posting.",,,,

I got banned for a photo I had in a private photo album from years ago PRIVATE, like only I could see it, and on top of it, it was a meme wasnt anything to be taken seriously, I dont understand the and why my account is targeted all the time for nothing, and Facebook doesnt care about its users or it would fix this.",,,,

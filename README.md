## Exploring Privacy Requirements Gap Between Developers and End Users



### A case study with Facebook

 1. Retrieve privacy-related user reviews with sentence embeddings and cosine similarity; (jupyter 1-3)
 
 2. Perform LDA modeling on the retrieved privacy-related reviews and determine the best TOPIC NUM according to the topic coherence measure $C_{v}$; (jupyter 4, lda_c_V.ipynb)
 
 3. Analyze the generated reviews topics and compare the content between reviews and the privacy policy statements. (jupyter 5)
 
### Data and code

1. All of raw data, middle results, and final results are in this repository, you can investigate the details of data files by viewing their content and the codes related to them.

2. All of the experimental codes (jupyter notebooks) are in this repository and the functions of each code file are described in the above section;

3. You can run the codes in cloud jupyter environment (recommended ,e.g., Kaggle, Google Colab.) or in your local computer (you may install some dependency packages, e.g. spacy, nltk, gensim etc.).
